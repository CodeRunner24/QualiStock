**Jury Members:** Eren Ulu, Fırat Akba

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Description

The AI-Powered Inventory and Quality Monitoring System is an innovative solution designed to automate stock management and quality control processes using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This system aims to address the challenges faced by businesses dealing with large volumes of perishable goods in industries such as retail and food.

The project will develop a comprehensive system that integrates real-time stock tracking, product quality assessment, deterioration level monitoring, expiration date tracking, and inventory forecasting. By leveraging image recognition and data analysis, the system will significantly reduce manual processes, minimize product waste, and optimize inventory management decisions.

Key features of the system include:
- Automated stock tracking
- Product quality control through visual defect detection
- Deterioration level assessment using machine learning model
- Expiration date tracking
- Inventory forecasting based on historical sales data analysis

### 1.2 Constraints

#### 1. Economic:
- Development costs for AI models and infrastructure
- Potential need for specialized hardware (cameras)
- Training costs for staff to use the new system

#### 2. Environmental:
- Energy consumption of continuous image processing and data analysis
- Energy consumption of deep learning model
- Disposal considerations for any hardware components

#### 3. Social:
- Potential resistance from employees due to fear of job displacement
- Need for clear communication about the system's benefits and limitations

#### 4. Political:
- Compliance with local and international regulations on data privacy and storage
- Adherence to food safety standards and reporting requirements

#### 5. Ethical:
- Ensuring fairness and avoiding bias in AI decision-making processes
- Transparency in how the system makes inventory and quality assessments

#### 6. Health and Safety:
- Ensuring the system accurately identifies health risks in perishable goods
- Implementing fail-safes to prevent the sale of potentially harmful products

#### 7. Manufacturability:
- Scalability of the system for different business sizes and types
- Integration capabilities with existing inventory management systems

#### 8. Sustainability:
- Long-term viability of the AI models and their ability to adapt to changing product lines
- Sustainable data storage and processing practices

### 1.3 Professional and Ethical Issues

#### Data Privacy and Security:
- The system will be designed with robust security measures to protect sensitive business data
- Compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR, will be ensured

#### Algorithmic Transparency:
- Clear explanations of how the AI makes decisions will be provided
- Human oversight and the ability to intervene in critical decisions will be incorporated

#### Continuous Learning and Improvement:
- The system will be continuously updated and improved to ensure optimal performance
- Advancements in AI and computer vision technologies will be monitored to keep the system up-to-date

#### Ethical Use of AI:
- The AI will be restricted to inventory and quality management functions, avoiding use beyond its intended scope
- Broader implications of AI deployment in business operations will be considered to ensure ethical use

#### Professional Responsibility:
- High standards in software development and testing will be maintained
- Black-box testing will be done to check the integrity of the project
- Comprehensive documentation and user training materials will be provided to staff

#### Stakeholder Communication:
- The system's capabilities and limitations will be clearly communicated to all stakeholders
- Project specification and Service Level Agreement (SLA) will be clearly explained to stakeholders and product owner
- Feedback and concerns from users and affected parties will be addressed openly

#### Environmental Responsibility:
- The system will be designed to minimize unnecessary waste and reduce energy consumption
- Project's aim is to reduce the wastage of food and goods based on computer vision - deep learning promoting environmental benefit
- Sustainable inventory practices will be promoted through accurate forecasting and management
